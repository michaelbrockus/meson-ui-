# Meson-UI

## About

* * *

Meson-UI is a lightweight and developer-friendly GUI that provides
a simplistic way to interact with the venerable Meson build system,
it is also a cross-platform application meaning it can run on most
common host systems.

The main design goals of Meson-UI is to provide a standalone portable
build GUI and allow the users of the Meson build system to access all
or most of Meson build systems features with minimal effort.

## Program Preview

Please add an image for the user to see.

## Tooling information

* * *

Targeted audience we are building for is Windwos 10, MacOSX and Linux
users. This project uses [Python](https://www.python.org/) `3.8.x` and newer.

## Test, Install and Run

* * *

We should make sure the test run with no failed test cases:

```console
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m pytest test/run_tests.py
```

Installing should be easy. We install the application like so:

```console
python3 setup.py install
```

And finally we run this cool application:

```console
meson-ui
```
